							<strong>PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPT</strong>
							<p class="color-text" style="text-align:left">The language of presentation for all papers is English. To ensure consistency and readability, please type each manuscript single-spaced on A4 paper (8.5" x 11") with 1-inch margins. The manuscript should be organized in the following sequence: Title, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, Acknowledgment, and References. Adhering to this order will facilitate a clear and logical flow of information within your paper.</p>
							<strong>TITLE PAGE</strong>
							<p class="color-text" style="text-align:left">The title page should include essential information presented in a clear format. The paper's title should be written in bold face, title case, and font size 14. The names of the authors should follow in normal face, uppercase, and font size 12. Do not include prefixes any like Dr., Mr., Mrs., Prof. in front of author names. The authors' affiliations should be provided in normal face, lowercase. The corresponding author should be indicated with an asterisk mark. The title should be concise, accurately reflecting the nature of the work being communicated. Authors' names should be listed using initials followed by surnames. At the bottom left corner of the title page, please include the phrase "*Address for Correspondence" along with a functional email address. If the corresponding author's address differs from the affiliations already provided, it should be indicated separately. By adhering to these formatting guidelines, we can ensure clarity and effective communication of the manuscript's content. Please ensure accuracy and completeness when preparing the title page.</p>
							<strong>ABSTRACT</strong>
							<p class="color-text" style="text-align:left">The abstract section should begin on a new page following the title page. To set it apart from the introduction, it should be typed in single-space format. The abstract serves as a concise summary of the study and is especially important as many databases primarily list abstracts. It is recommended that the abstract be between 150 to 250 words, providing a brief overview of all the key aspects of the research. Crafting a comprehensive abstract allows readers to quickly grasp the essential points of the manuscript.</p>
							<strong>KEYWORDS</strong>
							<p class="color-text" style="text-align:left">After the abstract, please include four to six relevant keywords. These keywords should accurately represent the main themes or topics addressed in the manuscript. Choosing appropriate keywords helps facilitate effective indexing and searching of the article, enabling readers to easily locate and access the content they are interested in.</p>
							<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
							<p class="color-text" style="text-align:left">The introduction section should provide a concise overview of the research problem, followed by a brief review of the existing literature. This sets the context for the study and helps readers understand the background and significance of the research. Additionally, clearly state the objectives of the research, highlighting the specific goals and aims that the study aims to achieve. By presenting a clear and focused introduction, readers can grasp the purpose and motivation behind the research.</p>
							<strong>MATERIALS AND METHODS</strong>
							<p class="color-text" style="text-align:left">This should include a brief description of the procedures, techniques, or instruments used to gather the necessary information. By presenting a summary of the materials and methods, readers can gain insight into the experimental setup and data collection process.</p>
							<strong>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</strong>
							<p class="color-text" style="text-align:left">This segment should focus on the fulfillment of stated objectives as given in the introduction. It should contain the findings presented in the form of tables, figures and photographs.</p>
							<strong>REFERENCES</strong>
							<p class="color-text" style="text-align:left">The references must be in Vancouver style only. It should be numbered consecutively based on their first mention in the text, following a numerical order rather than alphabetical. In-text citations, as well as references mentioned in tables and legends, should be indicated by Arabic numerals in superscript format. References cited solely within tables or figure legends should be numbered according to the sequence established by their initial identification in the text of the respective table or figure. This consistent numbering system helps maintain clarity and ensures accurate referencing throughout the manuscript.</p>

							<strong>ABBREVIATIONS, UNITS ETC</strong>
							<p class="color-text" style="text-align:left">Our journal strictly adheres to the guidelines outlined in the IUPAC Manual of symbols and terminology for physicochemical quantities and units. By following these established rules, we ensure consistency and accuracy in the representation of scientific measurements and units. This commitment to standardized terminology and symbols enhances the clarity and understanding of the published research within the field of pharmaceutical sciences.</p>
							<strong>SHORT COMMUNICATION</strong>
							<p class="color-text" style="text-align:left">In addition to full papers, our journal also welcomes the submission of short communications. Short communications are ideal for sharing exciting findings, preliminary data, or studies that may not contain sufficient information to warrant a full paper. While short communications follow the same formatting requirements as full papers, they are limited to a maximum of 10 pages in length. It is important to note that short communications should not include subtitles such as Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, and Discussion. Instead, these sections should be seamlessly integrated into the running text. Ideally, short communications should include 3 to 4 illustrations, which can effectively support and enhance the presentation of the research findings. By providing a platform for concise yet impactful scientific contributions, short communications offer researchers the opportunity to share important discoveries in a succinct manner.</p>

							<p class="color-text" style="text-align:left">Review articles, a significant part of our journal, are expected to be approximately 15 to 30 pages in length. They should offer up-to-date information and provide a comprehensive coverage of the relevant literature pertaining to the chosen topic. Ideally, review articles are authored by scientists who possess a profound understanding and expertise in the subject matter. These articles follow the same formatting requirements as full papers, ensuring consistency in the presentation and structure. By publishing high-quality review articles, we aim to provide readers with valuable insights, synthesis of knowledge, and a broader understanding of the selected research area.</p>
